## CalEnviroscreen Indicators, but for the City of Los Angeles

Researchers, community advocates, and decision makers have used CalEnviroScreen as a relevant data source in identifying areas impacted by envrionmental and socioeconomic issues. 
However, the current CalEnviroScreen application shows indicators for the entire state of California. EnviroscreenLA is a static website that shows these indicators, but is easily visualized for the City of Los Angeles.
This helps researchers focused specifically on the City to quickly identify where issues such as pollution burden, poverty, and its overlap with racial demographics exist. 
The button functionality allows for quick comparsion of the different indicators for easier analysis.
